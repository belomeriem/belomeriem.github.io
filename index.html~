    <em>Sixth IEEE Workshop on Spoken Language Technology (SLT

   <p><small>We propose an approach in which we inject a crosslingual semantic frame based objective function directly into inversion transduction grammar (ITG) induction in order to semantically train spoken language translation systems. This approach represents a follow-up of our recent work on improving machine translation quality by tuning loglinear mixture weights using a semantic frame based objective function in the late, final stage of statistical machine translation training. In contrast, our new approach injects a semantic frame based objective function back into earlier stages of the training pipeline, during the actual learning of the translation model, biasing learning toward semantically more accurate alignments. Our work is motivated by the fact that ITG alignments have empirically been shown to fully cover crosslingual semantic frame alternations. We show that injecting a crosslingual semantic based objective function for driving ITG induction further sharpens the ITG constraints, leading to better performance than either the conventional ITG or the traditional GIZA++ based approaches.</small></p>

    <em>Sixth Workshop on Hybrid Approaches to Translation (HyTra-6)</em>. Osaka, Japan: Dec 2016.
   <p><small>We introduce a new statistical machine translation approach specifically geared to learning translation from low resource languages, that exploits monolingual English semantic parsing to bias inversion transduction grammar (ITG) induction. We show that in contrast to conventional statistical machine translation (SMT) training methods, which rely heavily on phrase memorization, our approach focuses on learning bilingual correlations that help translating low resource languages, by using the output language semantic structure to further narrow down ITG constraints. This approach is motivated by previous research which has shown that injecting a semantic frame based objective function while training SMT models improves the translation quality. We show that including a monolingual semantic objective function during the learning of the translation model leads towards a semantically driven alignment which is more efficient than simply tuning loglinear mixture weights against a semantic frame based evaluation metric in the final stage of statistical machine translation training. We test our approach with three different language pairs and demonstrate that our model biases the learning towards more semantically correct alignments. Both GIZA++ and ITG based techniques fail to capture meaningful bilingual constituents, which is required when trying to learn translation models for low resource languages. In contrast, our proposed model not only improve translation by injecting a monolingual objective function to learn bilingual correlations during early training of the translation model, but also helps to learn more meaningful correlations with a relatively small data set, leading to a better alignment compared to either conventional ITG or traditional GIZA++ based approaches.</small></p>

   <p><small>We describe a new approach for semantically training spoken language translation systems, in which we inject a crosslingual semantic frame based objective function directly into inversion transduction grammar (ITG) induction. This represents an ambitious jump from recent work on improving translation adequacy by using a semantic frame based objective function to drive the tuning of loglinear mixture weights in the final stage of statistical machine translation training. In contrast, our new approach propagates a semantic frame based objective function back into much earlier stages of the pipeline, during the actual learning of the translation model, biasing learning toward semantically more accurate alignments. This approach is motivated by the fact that ITG alignments have empirically been shown to fully cover crosslingual semantic frame alternations, even though they rule out an overwhelming majority of the space of possible alignments. We show that directly driving ITG induction with a crosslingual semantic based objective function not only helps to further sharpen the ITG constraints, but still avoids excising relevant portions of the search space, and leads to better performance than either conventional ITG or GIZA++ based approaches.</small></p>

    <em>5th Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics  (*SEM 2016), at ACL 2016</em>, 55-63. Berlin: Aug 2016.
   <p><small>We describe a new technique for improving statistical machine translation training by adopting scores from a recent
    crosslingual semantic frame based evaluation metric, XMEANT, as outside
    probabilities in expectation-maximization based ITG (inversion transduction
    grammars) alignment. Our new approach strongly biases early-stage SMT
    learning towards semantically valid alignments. Unlike previous attempts
    that have proposed using semantic frame based evaluation metrics as the
    objective function for late-stage tuning of less than a dozen loglinear
    mixture weights, our approach instead applies the semantic metric at one of
    the earliest stages of SMT training, where it may impact millions of model
    parameters. The choice of XMEANT is motivated by empirical studies that have
    shown ITG constraints to cover almost all crosslingual semantic frame
    alternations, which resemble the crosslingual semantic frame matching
    measured by XMEANT. Our experiments purposely restrict training data to
    small amounts to show the technique's utility in the absence of a huge
    corpus, to study the effects of semantic generalizations while avoiding
    overreliance on memorization. Results show that directly driving ITG
    training with the crosslingual semantic frame based objective function not
    only helps to further sharpen the ITG constraints, but still avoids excising
    relevant portions of the search space, and leads to better performance than
    either conventional ITG or GIZA++ based approaches.</small></p>

    <em>3rd International Workshop on Semantic Machine Learning (SML  2016), at IJCAI 2016</em>. New York: Jul 2016.
   <p><small>We propose a new algorithm to induce    inversion transduction grammars, in which a crosslingual semantic frame    based objective function is injected as confidence weighting in the early    stages of statistical machine translation training. Unlike recent work on    improving translation adequacy that uses a monolingual semantic frame based    objective function to drive the tuning of loglinear mixture weights in the    late stages of statistical machine translation training, our bilingual    approach incorporates the semantic objective during the actual learning of    the translation model's structure. Our approach assigns higher confidence to    training examples in which the semantic frames in the input language more    closely match the semantic frames of the output language, as predicted    automatically by XMEANT, the crosslingual semantic frame based machine    translation evaluation metric. We chose to apply this approach to induce    inversion transduction grammars (ITGs), since ITG alignments prune a large    majority of the space of possible alignments, while at the same time    empirically fully covering all the crosslingual semantic frame alternations    of the type we are using for confidence weighting. Results show that    boosting semantically compatible training examples in ITG induction improves    the translation performance compared to either traditional GIZA++ alignment    or conventional ITG alignment based approaches for phrase based statistical    machine translation.</small></p>

<p><small>
We show that applying semantic role label constraints to bracketing ITG alignment to train MT systems improves the quality of MT output in comparison to the conventional BITG and GIZA alignments. Moreover, we show that applying soft constraints to SRL-constrained BITG alignment leads to a better translation system compared to using hard constraints which appear too harsh to produce meaningful biparses. We leverage previous work demonstrating that BITG alignments are able to fully cover cross-lingual semantic frame alternations, by using semantic role labeling to further narrow BITG constraints, in a soft fashion that avoids losing relevant portions of the search space. SRL-based evaluation metrics like MEANT have shown that tuning towards preserving the shallow semantic structure across translations, robustly improves translation performance. Our approach brings the same intuition into the training phase. We show that our new alignment outperforms both conventional Moses and BITG alignment baselines in terms of the adequacy-oriented MEANT scores, while still producing comparable results in terms of edit distance metrics.

  Based Semantically Tuned SMT</a>". <em>11th International Workshop
  on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT 2014)</em>, 34-41. Lake Tahoe, California: Dec 2014.
    <p><small>We discuss various improvements to our MEANT tuned system, previously presented
at IWSLT 2013. In our 2014 system, we incorporate this year's improved version
of MEANT, improved Chinese word segmentation, Chinese named entity recognition
and dedicated proper name translation, and number expression handling. This
results in a significant performance jump compared to last year's system. We
also ran preliminary experiments on tuning to IMEANT, our new ITG based variant
of MEANT. The performance of tuning to IMEANT is comparable to tuning on MEANT
(differences are statistically insignificant). We are presently investigating
if tuning on IMEANT can produce even better results, since IMEANT was actually
shown to correlate with human adequacy judgment more closely than MEANT.
Finally, we ran experiments applying our new architectural improvements to a
contrastive system tuned to BLEU. We observed a slightly higher jump in
comparison to last year, possibly due to mismatches of MEANT's similarity
models to our new entity handling.</small></p>

  Workshop on Syntax, Semantics and Structure
  in Statistical Translation (at EMNLP 2014)</em>, 22-33. Doha: Oct 2014.
    <p><small>We introduce an inversion transduction grammar based restructuring
	of the MEANT automatic semantic frame based MT evaluation metric,
	which, by leveraging ITG language biases, is able to further improve
	upon MEANT's already-high correlation with human adequacy judgments.
	The new metric, called IMEANT, uses bracketing ITGs to biparse the
	reference and machine translations, but subject to obeying the semantic
	frames in both. Resulting improvements support the presumption that
	ITGs, which constrain the allowable permutations between compositional
	segments across the reference and MT output, score the phrasal similarity
	of the semantic role fillers more accurately than the simple word
	alignment heuristics (bag-of-word alignment or maximum alignment)
	used in previous version of MEANT. The approach successfully integrates
	(1) the previously demonstrated extremely high coverage of cross-lingual
	semantic frame alternations by ITGs, with (2) the high accuracy of
	evaluating MT via weighted f-scores on the degree of semantic frame
	preservation.</small></p>

    <em>52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational
  Linguistics (ACL
  2014)</em>, 765-771. Baltimore, Maryland: Jun 2014.
   <p><small>We introduce XMEANT---a new cross-lingual version of the semantic frame based MT evaluation metric MEANT---which can correlate even more closely with human adequacy judgments than monolingual MEANT and eliminates the need for expensive human references. Previous work established that MEANT reflects translation adequacy with state-of-the-art accuracy, and optimizing MT systems against MEANT robustly improves translation quality. However, to go beyond tuning weights in the loglinear SMT model, a cross-lingual objective function that can deeply integrate semantic frame criteria into the MT training pipeline is needed. We show that cross-lingual XMEANT outperforms monolingual MEANT by (1) replacing the monolingual context vector model in MEANT with simple translation probabilities, and (2) incorporating bracketing ITG constraints.</small></p>

translation into Chinese by tuning against Chinese MEANT</a>". <em>10th International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT 2013)</em>. Heidelberg, Germany: Dec 2013.
    <p><small>We present the first ever results showing
    that Chinese MT output is significantly improved by tuning a MT system
    against a semantic frame based objective function, MEANT, rather than an
    n-gram based objective function, BLEU, as measured across commonly used
    metrics and different test sets. Recent work showed that by preserving the
    meaning of the translations as captured by semantic frames in the training
    process, MT systems for translating into English on both formal and informal
    genres are constrained to produce more adequate translations by making more
    accurate choices on lexical output and reordering rules. In this paper we
    describe our experiments in IWSLT 2013 TED talk MT tasks on tuning MT
    systems against MEANT for translating into Chinese and English respectively.
    We show that the Chinese translation output benefits more from tuning a MT
    system against MEANT than the English translation output due to the
    ambiguous nature of word boundaries in Chinese. Our encouraging results show
    that using MEANT is a promising alternative to BLEU in both evaluating and
    tuning MT systems to drive the progress of MT research across different
    languages.</small></p>

    <p><small>We attack an inexplicably under-explored language genre of spoken language "lyrics in music" via completely unsupervised induction of an SMT-style stochastic transduction grammar for hip hop lyrics, yielding a fully-automatically learned challenge-response system that produces rhyming lyrics given an input. Unlike previous efforts, we choose the domain of hip hop lyrics, which is particularly unstructured and noisy. A novel feature of our approach is that it is completely unsupervised and requires no a priori linguistic or phonetic knowledge. In spite of the level of difficulty of the challenge, the model nevertheless produces fluent output as judged by human evaluators, and performs significantly better than widely used phrase-based SMT models upon the same task.</small></p>
